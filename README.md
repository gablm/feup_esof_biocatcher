## Business Modelling

### Product Vision

Learning about animals made fun, we bring nature to your fingertips.

### Features and Assumptions

#### Features

- Login - Allows the user to keep their progress
- Battle - Allows the user to engage in battles between animals
- BioDex - Stores the user's animals and shows their characteristics
- Lootboxes - Box opening system to collect animals (gambling mechanic)
- Interactive map - Map of Portugal divided by regions where you can check their respective fauna and look up your completion for each region.
- Animal cards - Each animal has a card that gives information about their stats, level and general information about conservation status, average weight, longevity, etc.

#### Dependencies

- Firebase Store - Relational database service
- Firebase Authentication - Handles user criation and athentication
- Google Maps API - Used to display the map


### Elevator Pitch
Embark on an adventure to discover Portugal's rich biodiversity with BioCatcher, the app that turns our native fauna into an exciting journey. From the majestic iberian lynx to the slender lusitanian salamander, embark on quests to collect  and learn more about the creatures that hide in Portugal's forests, rivers and seas. But it's more than a game - it's a platform where everyone can learn and educate themselves about wildlife and contribute to conservation efforts while having fun! There are so many interesting animals to discover, come and start your journey now!

</p>

### Vertical prototype

Our app main feature is being able to check a map and find out about region-specific animals.
As such, one of the main challanges is the implementation of this map and finding a way to write over it.

While at this phase only the label "Viseu" can be seen, it is possible to implement such concept and our current implementation allows us to put text in any tile, at a specific zoom.
